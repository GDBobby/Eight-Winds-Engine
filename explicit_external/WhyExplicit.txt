In short
this is for libraries that I'm either not allowed to redistribute (Nvidia Aftermath)
or for libraries in which it'd be significantly easier for the user to set up the library rather than cmake

I'm not a lawyer, so I don't quite understand if I'm allowed to redistribute Aftermath including the license or not, but I don't see any of the other engines I referenced including it, so I won't.

Instructions for setting up Nvidia Aftermath (why can't I do preprocessor instructions to determine whether a lib should be included or not?)
1. Obtain SDK - https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-aftermath
2. From the downloaded SDK file
	2.1 copy the include folder to Eight-Winds-Engine/explicit_external/Aftermath/
	2.2 copy the GFSDK_Aftermath_Lib.x64.lib file to Eight-Winds-Engine/explicit_external/Aftermath/lib/
