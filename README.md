# Eight-Winds-Engine

First public release!
The engine still needs quite a few things and I'll be working on it for the forseeable future. 
* The main pressing issue is I'm currently replacing irrklang with miniaudio and only halfway through. The code for irrklang support included if a user would like to miniaudio.
* Next up on the chopping block is a cmake file (I don't understand cmake)
* an Editor with GUI will be added at some point
